## Purpose: This app serves as my personal portfolio website. It's written in Next.js.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
First, install dependencies:
```bash
npm i

pnpm i
# or
bun i
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
